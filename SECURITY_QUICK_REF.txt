Failed Attempt #3  →  Counter = 3/5
Failed Attempt #4  →  Counter = 4/5
Failed Attempt #5  →  🔒 ACCOUNT LOCKED FOR 15 MINUTES

Successful login    →  All counters reset
```

## Bypass Prevention

### ❌ Cannot Bypass By:
- Modifying localStorage
- Using browser developer tools
- Changing CSS display properties
- Removing login modal
- Refreshing page
- Accessing from different device
- Using old session tokens
- Disabling JavaScript

### Why?
```
→ Every action triggers authentication check
→ Session includes device fingerprint
→ Main content locked until valid session
→ Activity monitoring catches manipulation
→ Device mismatch detected immediately
```
